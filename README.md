# Cordova App

**Listen Up:** this is merely a concept app for [Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams](https://jenis.com/). I do not own any of the images on the site and this is **NOT** a real app that can be found in any app store. This app is ***student work***, if you will, as I am constantly teaching myself new skills and chose to represent a company I have yes, previusly worked for and do truly admire.

This is intented as a practice project as I navigate the ins and outs of Cordova app development. The project is built using `Cordova`, `Phonegap`, `Angular`, and `Ionic.` Initial setup is based off of tutorial by [Chris Nwamba](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-your-first-mobile-app-with-angularjs-and-ionic). The app builds to the following platforms:
* IOS
* Andriod
* Mobile Browsers
