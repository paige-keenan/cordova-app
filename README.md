# Cordova App
This is intented as a practice project as I navigate the ins and outs of Cordova app development. The project is built using `Cordova`, `Phonegap`, `Angular`, and `Ionic.` Initial setup is based off of tutorial by [Chris Nwamba](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-your-first-mobile-app-with-angularjs-and-ionic). The app builds to the following platforms:
* Ios
* Andriod
* Mobile Browsers
